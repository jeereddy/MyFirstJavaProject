        From Java 8, Spliterator is added to this group of iterators. As the name itself suggest,
        Spliterator performs partitioning as well as iterating. It is most suitable for parallel programming.
        Using old Iterators, you can iterate only collection types. But, Spliterator can be used to iterate
        collections, arrays and streams. */
